## To do development:
This will start webpack and electron. Sadly, with no hot reload.

`npm start`

## To package
This will create an unpacked version of your application.

`npm run pack`

## To build release:
THis will create a distributable version of your application, in this case - a windows portable exe.

`npm run dist`

## What is this?

A barebones `Electron` + `Typescript` setup.

## TODO
- Figure out hot reaload.
